iPlayer description:<br>
Advent 1: Longing for wisdom
<br><br>
A service for Advent from Mayfield Salisbury Parish Church, Edinburgh.
<br><br>
As Christmas approached, worship in the early centuries of the Christian church would direct thoughts towards the coming of Christ: looking back to his birth and forward to his return at the end of time. Lines inspired by scripture would be sung as a reminder of these events and humanity's continual longing for the kingdom of God. This week's service looks at humanity's search for wisdom.
<br><br>
O Wisdom, coming forth from the mouth of the Most High, reaching from one end to the other mightily, and sweetly ordering all things: Come and teach us the way of prudence. Leader: The minister, the Revd Scott McKenna Preacher: The Revd Dr Alison Jack of New College, Edinburgh. With Edinburgh University Music Society Chorus directed by Neil Metcalfe. Organist: John Willmett
<br><br>
Producer: Mo McCullough.
