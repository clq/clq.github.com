On the political aspects of the killings in Norway, also, an open letter to Gus B Baker

Hi Gus.

I don't know you, and you don't know me. However, the past hour I have seen some of your tweets be re-tweeted, and they make me very angry. Sorry if this seems a bit disjointed. I haven't been directly affected myself, but my hands are still shaking from what has happened, as they have done for about 24 hours.

Firstly, a bit about myself. I'm a Norwegian studying in Edinburgh, currently on summer holiday at home in Norway. I don't align with any party, but in UK terms I am much more sympathetic toward the Labour party than I am toward any of the other parties.

Now, I am sure you are a great guy. You are obviously politically engaged, and I admire that. Now, why are you angering me? Because your tweets demonstrate a lack of understanding of Norwegian culture, politics and people. And, I hope I am wrong, but it appears you are trying to use our tragedy to make political points.

Firstly, in reacting to this, even in the early phases, this was treated as the tragedy it is, not like an "attack on a political party" your tweets are describing. Tweets like "Norway consistently ranks best place to live in world thanks to their Labour Party. They are responding with 'more tolerance and democracy'" demonstrates that you are treating this in the political way which, fortunately, Norway isn't.

Norwegian politics are very different from UK politics. There aren't two parties shouting at each other, and the Labour party is in government with two other parties. Norwegian political parties aren't afraid of agreeing with each other, and the tone is generally very good between the political parties. Norwegian politics are friendly, and no one are making political points at this stage, because it is not needed.

Note that Norwegians weren't the ones initially screaming "Islamist Extremists!" in the start. That was the international media.

All political parties hold common basic values of what the Norwegian society should be like. These are the values which were attacked yesterday. The multiculturalism and openness of the Norwegian state was attacked. Yes, the Labour party is now going through absolutely horrible times, and it is absolutely a tragedy. But in Norway this is not being described as an attack on the Labour party, it is being regarded by an attack on our society. Our values. Our culture. It is a tragedy, and it upsets me seeing it being spun into something political.

And yes, I suppose calling this a "political killing" is valid, but it is misleading. The shooter was a far-right extremist, no more a politician than anyone else who use these kind of methods for getting their points across. All terror attacks are political killings, including this one.

And the quote is accurate, the Norwegian PM did say that the Labour Party was attacked, but it was a direct answer to a question. The tone was along the lines of "Is this an attack on the Norwegian Labour Party?" and his answer was along the lines of "Well, this is obviously an attack on the Labour Party camp" followed by general comments on how it was an attack on politics in general.

Anyhow, bottom line. This is not a party-politics thing. Don't make it one. Thank you.

Cheers, and, above all, thanks for caring. I do appreciate it.

Christian
