I can see that you're tired
But I can't walk all your steps for you
You must walk them yourself
But I will walk them with you
I will walk them with you

I can see that you're hurting
But I can't cry all your tears for you
You must cry them yourself
But I will cry with you
I will cry with you

I can see you want to give up
But I can't live your life for you
You must live it yourself
But I will live it with you
I will live it with you

I can see you are afraid
But I can't face death in your place
You must taste it yourself
But I make death into life for you
I make death into life for you
I've made death into life for you
I've made death into life for you
