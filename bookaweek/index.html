<h3>Book a week</h3>

		<td valign="top">So, for some reason I decided to try reading a book every week of the upcoming year. I know, I probably won't manage, but why not try? So, to motivate myself, here is a website logging my progress. I may be ahead of schedule, I may be behind schedule. We will see what happens. I hereby wish myself luck.</td>

		<td valign="top">Walter Isaacson:<br>"Steve Jobs"</td>
		<td valign="top">I am by no means much of a fan of Apple or Apple-products. However, this was a really interesting read. There are some parts, or rather a specific chunk, of this book I found to be really boring, but it was more than worth going through for the sake of the rest. No matter what one may think of him, Steve Jobs was an extremely influential person in the consumer electronics-market. As well as giving what seems like a very honest description of the kind of person Steve Jobs was, this book also gives a fascinating insight in how Apple operates, why it does what it does, and how this has made the company so successful. 4/5</td>

		<td valign="top">Agatha Christie:<br>"The Big Four"</td>
		<td valign="top">Part of my mission to read all the Christie-books, this is a Poirot mystery. Here Hercule takes on a case which turns out to be of global importance. This makes this book somewhat different in style to the standard "a guy has been killed by poison in his hot chocolate" kind of story. Not one of my favourites by Christie, but still a worthwhile read. 3.5/5</td>

		<td valign="top">Muriel Barbery:<br>"The Elegance of the Hedgehog"</td>
		<td valign="top">This book was absolutely brilliant. Translated from French, it initially seemed like a somewhat pretentious, overly philosophical book. However, after the first few chapters it had really reeled me in, and I was hooked. Yes, there is a lot of philosophy contained in this book, but not for its own sake. The book never gets too fond of itself, and the "artsy" parts of the book are more than justified by the story it tells, which turned out to be extremely gripping. One page would have me laughing out loud, the next page would make me feel genuinely sad. Yes, the setting may be a tad contrived, but... did I mention it is a brilliant story? Highly recommended. 5/5</td>

		<td valign="top">Oscar Wilde:<br>"The Picture of Dorian Gray"</td>
		<td valign="top">Well, what is there to say? A classic, and the first Wilde-book I have read. Not only is it a classic, but I had been told it was one of the classics that stands the test of time very well. I found this to be partially true. A lot of the time, especially during the first half of the book, I found myself getting a bit bored. Sure, there were a lot of thoughtful quotes, and a lot of "deep" things are said. Keeping in mind that this was written and published in the eighteen hundreds, the book must have been extremely progressive at the time, and a lot of things are said which one can only imagine would have been very controversial. However, I'm reading this book in 2012, and that is how I am judging it. Fortunately, as the story progresses, the story itself takes more of the focus, and I found myself going back to taking an interest in it. Overall the book pretty much matched my expectations, and I'd say it is well worth a read. It's entertaining enough to be worth it, and of course, when one finds onself in sophisticated, educated company one can be one of those people who say "Why, yes. <i>Of course</i> I've read The Picture of Dorian Gray. Who hasn't?" 4/5</td>

		<td valign="top">'Alan Partridge':<br>"I, Partridge: We Need To Talk About Alan"</td>
		<td valign="top">This is a mock-biography by Steve Coogan and Armando Iannucci, written in the voice of Alan Partridge. I should start by saying, I love Alan Partridge. While I was sceptical to how entertaining I would find this genre, I had high hopes. This book has really good reviews, and, after all, Armando Iannucci writes "The Thick of It". I, Partridge didn't live up to my expectations. It's an entertaining read, but it does drag on a bit, and some chapters are a lot better than others. There are some really funny parts, some great one-liners and very entertaining situations, but nothing that made me feel like I had to turn the page to read on. Perhaps I expected too much. Still a decent read, but not as good as I think it could have been. 3.5/5</td>
