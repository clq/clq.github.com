<h3>Book a week</h3>
<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="2">
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">So, for some reason I decided to try reading a book every week of the upcoming year. I know, I probably won't manage, but why not try? So, to motivate myself, here is a website logging my progress. I may be ahead of schedule, I may be behind schedule. We will see what happens. I hereby wish myself luck.<br><br>
        Week 1 started on the week beginning the 14th of May 2012. The goal is to have read 52 books by... well, 52 weeks on from the 14th of May.<br>

		<td valign="top">I am by no means much of a fan of Apple or Apple-products. However, this was a really interesting read. There are some parts, or rather a specific chunk, of this book I found to be really boring, but it was more than worth going through for the sake of the rest. No matter what one may think of him, Steve Jobs was an extremely influential person in the consumer electronics-market. As well as giving what seems like a very honest description of the kind of person Steve Jobs was, this book also gives a fascinating insight in how Apple operates, why it does what it does, and how this has made the company so successful. 4/5</td>

		<td valign="top">Part of my mission to read all the Christie-books, this is a Poirot mystery. Here Hercule takes on a case which turns out to be of global importance. This makes this book somewhat different in style to the standard "a guy has been killed by poison in his hot chocolate" kind of story. Not one of my favourites by Christie, but still a worthwhile read. 3.5/5</td>

		<td valign="top">This book was absolutely brilliant. Translated from French, it initially seemed like a somewhat pretentious, overly philosophical book. However, after the first few chapters it had really reeled me in, and I was hooked. Yes, there is a lot of philosophy contained in this book, but not for its own sake. The book never gets too fond of itself, and the "artsy" parts of the book are more than justified by the story it tells, which turned out to be extremely gripping. One page would have me laughing out loud, the next page would make me feel genuinely sad. Yes, the setting may be a tad contrived, but... did I mention it is a brilliant story? Highly recommended. 5/5</td>

		<td valign="top">Oscar Wilde:<br>"The Picture of Dorian Gray"</td>
		<td valign="top">Well, what is there to say? A classic, and the first Wilde-book I have read. Not only is it a classic, but I had been told it was one of the classics that stands the test of time very well. I found this to be partially true. A lot of the time, especially during the first half of the book, I found myself getting a bit bored. Sure, there were a lot of thoughtful quotes, and a lot of "deep" things are said. Keeping in mind that this was written and published in the eighteen hundreds, the book must have been extremely progressive at the time, and a lot of things are said which one can only imagine would have been very controversial. However, I'm reading this book in 2012, and that is how I am judging it. Fortunately, as the story progresses, the story itself takes more of the focus, and I found myself going back to taking an interest in it. Overall the book pretty much matched my expectations, and I'd say it is well worth a read. It's entertaining enough to be worth it, and of course, when one finds onself in sophisticated, educated company one can be one of those people who say "Why, yes. <i>Of course</i> I've read The Picture of Dorian Gray. Who hasn't?" 4/5</td>

		<td valign="top">'Alan Partridge':<br>"I, Partridge: We Need To Talk About Alan"</td>
		<td valign="top">This is a mock-biography by Steve Coogan and Armando Iannucci, written in the voice of Alan Partridge. I should start by saying, I love Alan Partridge. While I was sceptical to how entertaining I would find this genre, I had high hopes. This book has really good reviews, and, after all, Armando Iannucci writes "The Thick of It". I, Partridge didn't live up to my expectations. It's an entertaining read, but it does drag on a bit, and some chapters are a lot better than others. There are some really funny parts, some great one-liners and very entertaining situations, but nothing that made me feel like I had to turn the page to read on. Perhaps I expected too much. Still a decent read, but not as good as I think it could have been. 3.5/5</td>

		<td valign="top">Lionel Shriver:<br>"We Need To Talk About Kevin"</td>
		<td valign="top">I recently saw the film of this book, and I loved it. Even though plot-spoilers are thrown around rather liberally with regards to the story, I'll avoid them here. The story follows Eva, a mother who has ended up in a terrible situation. The film had me feeling desperately sorry for Eva throughout, so this is pretty much what I expected from the book. The book turned out to be more complicated, and rather than seeming to explicitly control the feelings of the reader, the reader is more open to feel what they like. More than a few times this had me wondering if I was supposed to be thinking what I thought, and whether my emotions were 'correct'. The story is told through the letters Eva writes to her husband, and she isn't looking for pity, nor making excuses. We follow Eva's train of thought as she tries to de-construct the terrible thing that has happened. Yes, I did feel very sorry for Eva, but I also found myself wondering along with her whether she actually could have done anything differently. Whether, or to what extent, she is to blame. Without asking questions directly, the book planted plenty. To what extent can parents affect who a child ends up being? How responsible is one for the actions of ones children? This is a good story, and it is told very cleverly. It was different from what I expected having watched the film, but not in a bad way. 4/5 </td>

		<td valign="top">For years my mother has kept saying "You should read this book", and for years I've been meaning to read it. So, being at home on holidays, I took the battered, older-than-myself, obviously well-read edition of this book off the shelf and got on with it. It is a travel-diary first published in 1882. Yes, <i>eighteen</i> hundred and eighty-two. The age of it is part of what makes it rather remarkable. It follows three Britons on their adventures fishing and hunting in the desolate mountains of Norway. It's written in a very dry, very funny, and very British style, and makes a number of rather witty observations about the Norwegian way of life, Norwegian nature and Norwegian people. The interesting thing is how many of these observations I find myself being able to relate to today, over a hundred years later. I really enjoyed the book and laughed out loud quite a few times reading it. Though, I'm probably biased. A rather entertaining read. 4/5 </td>

		<td valign="top">R.D. Wingfield:<br>"Frost At Christmas"</td>
		<td valign="top">This is the first book about Inspector Jack Frost, the source-material for the tv-series "A Touch of Frost". The book is considerably darker than what I recall the series being, and Jack is portrayed as a less likable character, but in the "you wouldn't expect like him, but you can't stop yourself from taking his side anyway"-antihero kind of way. The problem is that this is done without any subtlety, which got rather annoying after a while. Frost will be excessively obnoxious in a childish way, but a few pages later something is done or said that redeems him. The gradual revealing of Frost's intriguing, dark, history (because every conflicted detective needs one) seems forced, as if it was inserted into the book wherever an excuse could be found to fit it in. All that aside, this is a decent crime-mystery. The main plot is quite good, and the story held up better than I thought it would. Unfortunately there are also a lot of distracting elements. Among them are more than a few sexually themed asides, which purposefully border on what would be considered legally or morally acceptable. In some places it is relevant and justified by the story, but elsewhere it seems to be used, excessively, to build under the already artificial-seeming 'dark' mood and tone of the story. Still though, this is a good detective-story, but it could probably have been told a bit better. 3.5/5 </td>

		<td valign="top">Having read the Narnia-books before, when I was very young, I've been re-reading them in published order. This is the fifth of the seven books. Save for the Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe, this is my favourite books of the chronicles so far. It reads like a fairy-tale, and I found myself mentally reading it out loud to myself rather than just reading it. Sure, it is a little childish at times, but I still found this book to be very enjoyable, even at 23. 4/5 </td>

		<td valign="top">The English translation of this book, "Headhunters", has been on the bestseller-lists in the UK for quite a while. Also, I wanted to read this book before watching the film of it. However, having read Nesb&oslash before, and not quite liking it, I was a little sceptical. Fortunately I liked Hodejegerne better, perhaps partly because it doesn't include Harry Hole, the recurring character in quite a few of the other books, and a character I never quite liked. Hodejegerne is very original, both in its story, and in the way the story unfolds. The thing that bothered me throughout the book was the fact that I just didn't believe a lot of what was happening. At some point almost all of the main characters make choices which seem more than a little contrived. Still, this is a quick, rather fast-paced, sometimes genuinely thrilling, book. Worth a read. 4/5 </td>

		<td valign="top">Another Hercule Poirot story, and a relatively standard mystery. A woman gets killed. On a train of course. Who did it? The husband? The lover? The Butler? Who knows? Well, Poirot does. Not one of the best Christie's I've read, nor very original. Still, this book isn't bad. It continues to impress me how well Christie does dialogue. Even long-winded conversations between characters (of which there are quite a few in this book) somehow stay interesting and entertaining, yet plausible. I've come to expect that an Agatha Christie-book will keep me happy for the time it takes me to read it, and this one did. Just. 3.5/5 </td>

		<td valign="top">Many people have heard about Game of Thrones by now. Most of them, myself included, probably wouldn't have unless HBO had made A Song of Ice and Fire into a tv-series. As everyone said the tv-series was great I gave it a try, but after a few episodes I didn't like it as much as everyone said I should. Then I was told that I would certainly like the books. I did. At least I've loved the first one.<br> Mr. Martin has really created a huge, rather complex, and truly impressive world in which the story takes place. Though, the most impressive thing is not the world itself, but how effortlessly and naturally I became immersed in it. I'm not quite sure how or when it happened, but after 150 pages I was engaged in the book, and couldn't wait to find out what happened next. And that's another thing which sets this book apart, there really isn't a way of knowing what happens next. It doesn't take long to realise that most of the regular tropes are thrown to the wind by this book, and once you acknowledge that anything could happen, it makes it all the more exciting to see which one of those anythings actually does happen.<br> Over almost a thousand pages I was never bored of this book. Even after hours of reading, I never didn't feel like reading the next chapter right away. Despite many sub-plots being dealt with at the same time, they never became hard to follow. I really enjoyed this book, and I would hereby like to berate all of my friends who've read it, and who haven't recommended it to me until now. 5/5 </td>

		<td valign="top">Tom Reynolds:<br>"Blood, Sweat and Tea"</td>
		<td valign="top">Recommended by a friend, this was very much a random choice of reading material, and I am glad I chose it. It is a collection of blog-posts written by an employee of the London Ambulance Service. Through the posts, which are generally only a page or two long, the writer recounts regular, less regular, and rather irregular experiences he has had while on the job. Part of the reason I liked this book was the 'behind the scenes' look it gave at the ambulance service. If anything, it has reassured me that the Ambulance Service are dedicated people who know what they are doing, will help in the best way they can, and will, most of the time, provide an excellent service. On the flip-side, large parts of this book are also very scary, disturbing, and incredibly dark to someone like me. While told in a factual, non-tabloid, manner, stories from real life about dead babies, heart attacks and crying relatives are never pleasant to read. Of course, the book also has its share of light-heartedness, and stories with happy endings. Overall I guess the book paints a picture of reality, with all the shades that go along with that. The book is very well written, rarely gets repetitive, and often got my heart beating faster as I wondered what the outcome of a particular 'job' was going to be. If you think you might like a book with real stories from an employee in the ambulance service, you will really like this book. If you don't, you might not. Either way, with a bit of Googling it is available (legally) as a free ebook, so you might as well give it a try. 4/5 </td>

		<td valign="top">Joseph Conrad:<br>"The Secret Agent"</td>
		<td valign="top">This is a random read from the "1001 books you should read before you die"-list, so I knew nothing about this book other than its title. I started reading, and from the start I really didn't like it. In fact, I actively disliked it. I found the first half of the book to be a muddled and messy blend of politics, social commentary, satire and attempts at humour. As standalone elements all of these would probably have held up, but the way in which they were blended together made the story confusing, really hard to read, and disagreeable to me. Considering how little was actually happening, it was baffling how hard it was to keep up with it. <br> Then everything changed. <br> The mood of the book changed drastically. The relatively lighthearted, almost superficial, story turned dark. It became intense, emotional and gripping. One passage in particular, which takes up most of the second half of the book, had me completely gripped. The situation isn't particularly dramatic, but the way in which it is recounted is extremely immersive. After reading it I felt like I'd been holding my breath for a few hours. A lot of time is spent describing a very sort passage of time, yet not a word is wasted. One of the characters is in an extremely fragile emotional state, and as they get closer and closer to the edge, I found myself dreading what would happen when they fell off it. But I had to know. I had to continue reading. Way past when I should have gone to sleep. <br> Concluding anything about this book is very difficult. Perhaps the start of the book was necessary for the rest of it to be so good. Maybe the contrast in mood and tone is what made the book have such an impact on me. I'm not sure whether I'd recommend it or not. I really, really didn't enjoy the first part of the book, and I'm finding it hard to describe how much I enjoyed the last part. Take from that what you will. 3.5/5 </td>

		<td valign="top">Wilkie Collins:<br>"The Moonstone"</td>
		<td valign="top">I tend to be slightly sceptical toward books that are considered classics, especially the ones written ages ago. I was therefore somewhat sceptical toward The Moonstone, a classic which is almost 150 years old. My scepticism was put well and truly to shame. The Moonstone is an original mystery, in every sense of the word, which is centred around a valuable diamond said to be cursed. The story is told in the form of statements written after the fact by some of the people involved in the story, recounting events as they observed them. This works extremely well. The differences in perspective adds an additional level to a story which is already great. The personality of the writers shines through in the narratives written by them, and some of the more personal observations and musings of the characters made me laugh out loud to the extent at which I got looks, on both an airplane and a train. I could go on about how great this book is, and how much I enjoyed it, but I won't. I'd just encourage you to read it. Unless you really don't like the mystery-genre, I think you'll enjoy this book. If you're lucky, you'll enjoy it as much as I did. 4.5/5 </td>

		<td valign="top">Knut Hamsun:<br>"Sult" (Published in English as "Hunger")</td>
		<td valign="top">A Norwegian classic I finally got around to reading. The book is about a struggling writer who runs out of money and goes hungry. It didn't take me long to start feeling desperately sorry for this man. The really raw way in which his desperate hunger and, as a result, often miserable and sometimes deranged state of mind is described, made this book a very uncomfortable, but also a very thought-provoking read. Reading about the main character's unwillingness to ask for or accept charity out of pride and a sense of personal dignity genuinely frustrated me. I found myself urging the character to steal, rather than preserving his lawfulness at the risk of dying of hunger. Unfortunately, even though this book was published in 1890, it remains relevant. It will stay relevant as long as there are people who have to go hungry. Through telling a story it makes a very powerful point. No moral is stated, nor is any lecture given. It is just a story. A story which serves as a poignant reminder that no matter how uncomfortable one might be made to feel by that person sitting on the street, asking for ones money, one is extremely privileged to be the one being asked. 4/5 </td>
