<h3>Book a week</h3>
<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="2">
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">So, for some reason I decided to try reading a book every week of the upcoming year. I know, I probably won't manage, but why not try? So, to motivate myself, here is a website logging my progress. I may be ahead of schedule, I may be behind schedule. We will see what happens. I hereby wish myself luck.<br><br>
        Week 1 started on the week beginning the 14th of May 2012. The goal is to have read 52 books by... well, 52 weeks on from the 14th of May.<br>

		<td valign="top">I am by no means much of a fan of Apple or Apple-products. However, this was a really interesting read. There are some parts, or rather a specific chunk, of this book I found to be really boring, but it was more than worth going through for the sake of the rest. No matter what one may think of him, Steve Jobs was an extremely influential person in the consumer electronics-market. As well as giving what seems like a very honest description of the kind of person Steve Jobs was, this book also gives a fascinating insight in how Apple operates, why it does what it does, and how this has made the company so successful. 4/5</td>

		<td valign="top">Agatha Christie:<br>"The Big Four"</td>
		<td valign="top">Part of my mission to read all the Christie-books, this is a Poirot mystery. Here Hercule takes on a case which turns out to be of global importance. This makes this book somewhat different in style to the standard "a guy has been killed by poison in his hot chocolate" kind of story. Not one of my favourites by Christie, but still a worthwhile read. 3.5/5</td>

		<td valign="top">Muriel Barbery:<br>"The Elegance of the Hedgehog"</td>
		<td valign="top">This book was absolutely brilliant. Translated from French, it initially seemed like a somewhat pretentious, overly philosophical book. However, after the first few chapters it had really reeled me in, and I was hooked. Yes, there is a lot of philosophy contained in this book, but not for its own sake. The book never gets too fond of itself, and the "artsy" parts of the book are more than justified by the story it tells, which turned out to be extremely gripping. One page would have me laughing out loud, the next page would make me feel genuinely sad. Yes, the setting may be a tad contrived, but... did I mention it is a brilliant story? Highly recommended. 5/5</td>

		<td valign="top">Oscar Wilde:<br>"The Picture of Dorian Gray"</td>
		<td valign="top">Well, what is there to say? A classic, and the first Wilde-book I have read. Not only is it a classic, but I had been told it was one of the classics that stands the test of time very well. I found this to be partially true. A lot of the time, especially during the first half of the book, I found myself getting a bit bored. Sure, there were a lot of thoughtful quotes, and a lot of "deep" things are said. Keeping in mind that this was written and published in the eighteen hundreds, the book must have been extremely progressive at the time, and a lot of things are said which one can only imagine would have been very controversial. However, I'm reading this book in 2012, and that is how I am judging it. Fortunately, as the story progresses, the story itself takes more of the focus, and I found myself going back to taking an interest in it. Overall the book pretty much matched my expectations, and I'd say it is well worth a read. It's entertaining enough to be worth it, and of course, when one finds onself in sophisticated, educated company one can be one of those people who say "Why, yes. <i>Of course</i> I've read The Picture of Dorian Gray. Who hasn't?" 4/5</td>

		<td valign="top">'Alan Partridge':<br>"I, Partridge: We Need To Talk About Alan"</td>
		<td valign="top">This is a mock-biography by Steve Coogan and Armando Iannucci, written in the voice of Alan Partridge. I should start by saying, I love Alan Partridge. While I was sceptical to how entertaining I would find this genre, I had high hopes. This book has really good reviews, and, after all, Armando Iannucci writes "The Thick of It". I, Partridge didn't live up to my expectations. It's an entertaining read, but it does drag on a bit, and some chapters are a lot better than others. There are some really funny parts, some great one-liners and very entertaining situations, but nothing that made me feel like I had to turn the page to read on. Perhaps I expected too much. Still a decent read, but not as good as I think it could have been. 3.5/5</td>

		<td valign="top">Lionel Shriver:<br>"We Need To Talk About Kevin"</td>
		<td valign="top">I recently saw the film of this book, and I loved it. Even though plot-spoilers are thrown around rather liberally with regards to the story, I'll avoid them here. The story follows Eva, a mother who has ended up in a terrible situation. The film had me feeling desperately sorry for Eva throughout, so this is pretty much what I expected from the book. The book turned out to be more complicated, and rather than seeming to explicitly control the feelings of the reader, the reader is more open to feel what they like. More than a few times this had me wondering if I was supposed to be thinking what I thought, and whether my emotions were 'correct'. The story is told through the letters Eva writes to her husband, and she isn't looking for pity, nor making excuses. We follow Eva's train of thought as she tries to de-construct the terrible thing that has happened. Yes, I did feel very sorry for Eva, but I also found myself wondering along with her whether she actually could have done anything differently. Whether, or to what extent, she is to blame. Without asking questions directly, the book planted plenty. To what extent can parents affect who a child ends up being? How responsible is one for the actions of ones children? This is a good story, and it is told very cleverly. It was different from what I expected having watched the film, but not in a bad way. 4/5 </td>

		<td valign="top">J. A Lees and W. J. Clutterbuck:<br>"Three in Norway, By Two of Them"</td>
		<td valign="top">For years my mother has kept saying "You should read this book", and for years I've been meaning to read it. So, being at home on holidays, I took the battered, older-than-myself, obviously well-read edition of this book off the shelf and got on with it. It is a travel-diary first published in 1882. Yes, <i>eighteen</i> hundred and eighty-two. The age of it is part of what makes it rather remarkable. It follows three Britons on their adventures fishing and hunting in the desolate mountains of Norway. It's written in a very dry, very funny, and very British style, and makes a number of rather witty observations about the Norwegian way of life, Norwegian nature and Norwegian people. The interesting thing is how many of these observations I find myself being able to relate to today, over a hundred years later. I really enjoyed the book and laughed out loud quite a few times reading it. Though, I'm probably biased. A rather entertaining read. 4/5 </td>

		<td valign="top">R.D. Wingfield:<br>"Frost At Christmas"</td>
		<td valign="top">This is the first book about Inspector Jack Frost, the source-material for the tv-series "A Touch of Frost". The book is considerably darker than what I recall the series being, and Jack is portrayed as a less likable character, but in the "you wouldn't expect like him, but you can't stop yourself from taking his side anyway"-antihero kind of way. The problem is that this is done without any subtlety, which got rather annoying after a while. Frost will be excessively obnoxious in a childish way, but a few pages later something is done or said that redeems him. The gradual revealing of Frost's intriguing, dark, history (because every conflicted detective needs one) seems forced, as if it was inserted into the book wherever an excuse could be found to fit it in. All that aside, this is a decent crime-mystery. The main plot is quite good, and the story held up better than I thought it would. Unfortunately there are also a lot of distracting elements. Among them are more than a few sexually themed asides, which purposefully border on what would be considered legally or morally acceptable. In some places it is relevant and justified by the story, but elsewhere it seems to be used, excessively, to build under the already artificial-seeming 'dark' mood and tone of the story. Still though, this is a good detective-story, but it could probably have been told a bit better. 3.5/5 </td>
