Want to study in a foreign land?
Well youll have to do the best you can
You're in the IB now

Now you remember what Bjørn Uldal said
Youll constantly wish that you were back in bed
You're in the IB now
Oh, oh, you're in the IB now
 
Old IB students really saying you should
Theyr laughing their heads off when they leave for good
You're in the IB now
Oh, oh, you're in the IB now
 
Smiling teachers giving you advice
You are thinking of the life you sacrifice
You're in the IB now
Oh, oh, you're in the IB now
 
Lab reports taking over your head
Exams taking over your head
By now youv forgotten that you have a bed
You're in the IB now
Oh, oh, you're in the IB now
 
Your revising in the dead of night
Your family shouts out (Turn out the light!)
You're in the IB now
Oh, oh, you're in the IB now
 
On the exam day, the sun shines bright
Your writing down your answers
But they don't seem right
You're in the IB now
Oh, oh, you're in the IB now
You're in the IB now
Oh, oh, you're in the IB now
 
Now its all over and you just can't see
Are you alive, did you survive IB?
