So I got through it.
All my exams went
pretty well
Then why do I at this point feel so empty?
The IB diploma
The past two years have now reached the end.
It's been a part of all of us.
And now it's finished and done.
Now we all move onto
What we want to do next
Along with strange new students
Taking different subjects
But we all feel inside
With a slight bit of pride
We are still all part of
The IB

Why do I miss it?
Did I forget how hard it was?
The long and stressful, sleepless nights it gave me...
It tore me to pieces.
It made me forget my former friends
But still, I have the memories
Of all the good times I had
How I was taught in maths
The obscure uses of PI
How I learnt in TOK
The cake is a lie
All the people in my class
We shared a mission: To pass
For two years our lives were
The IB

Soon I'll be grown up
I'll have a job. A whole new life
The past will be a muddled pool of memories...
But when I think back
Back through the years I've left behind
It will always be there with me
It's a part of my soul
All those sleepless nights have made me what I'm today
And I would not want to have it any other way
It still puzzles me why
Till the day that I die
I will still be part of
The IB


What would I be without the IB?
Can't get my mind off the IB
Why am I obsessed by the IB?
What has it done to me, the IB?
I've been taken in by the IB
The IB
The IB
