Chemistry,
Oh, I should have learned my enthalpy,
Should have known this would combust on me,
I should have learned my Chemistry.

Frankly the,
IB would have been ashamed of me,
It was stupid to a large degree,
To put ceasium in my tea.

Why it
Had to blow I don't know, I just can't see.
Perhaps,
I should be more awake in Chemistry.

Chemistry,
Now it's all becoming clear to me,
And I'm sure that you would agree,
That life's enhanced by Chemistry.

Now I'm
Smarter, stronger, more attractive and happy too.
All because,
I learned Chemistry and so can you!

Chemistry,
Finally realised it is the key,
To the happiness inside of me,
My life was saved by Chemistry.

Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.
