Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby looks at her watch and decides what schoolwork to postpone,
She's all alone.
Like every friday, goes to bed dreaming 'bout schoolwork she'll do the next day,
No time for play

All the lonely people, seem strange to you and me
All the lonely people, they all attend IB

Stephen McKenzie, writing the words to an essay that noone will read,
Useless indeed.
Praktiseeng Engliiish, all the time watching his social life slowly decay
It's worth it in May

All the lonely people, seem strange to you and me
All the lonely people, they all attend IB
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, locked up in hospital, she became slightly insane
Part of the game
Staphen McKenzie, majored in English, was top of his class at Oxford;
Now he is bored.

All the lonely people, seem strange to you and me
(ah, look at all the lonely people)
All the lonely people, they all attend IB
(ah, look at all the lonely people)
