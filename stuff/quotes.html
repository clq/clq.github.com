<cite>From "The Luck of The Bodkins" by P. G. Wodehouse</cite>

<blockquote>The very nature of a Mickey Mouse makes it easy for a seeker after it to detect whether it is or is not present in any given spot.

<blockquote>Out, out! Get out! Out before I slash your throat with a knife and hang you dripping with blood from the flag-pole. Out, before I pull your guts from your body and stuff them down your mouth. Out, before I become mildly irritated. Go, hence, begone. Stand not upon the order of your going, but go at once. Run! run quickly from here, run to the other side of Europe, flee for your life nor give not one backward glance. I never hope to see you again in this world or the next. Never speak to me, never approach me, never advertise your presence to me by the smallest sound, or by the living God that made me I will do such things . . . I know not what they are but they will be terrors of the earth. Flee hence, be not here, but somewhere in a vast Elsewhere to which I have no access. Boys who rub me up the wrong way, Newton, come to a sticky end. Be removed, piss off, beraus, get utterly outly out.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
 The beauty of military life, No questions, only orders and flight. Only flight.
What a beautiful sight in his wild blue dream, the eternal child leafs through his war magazines. And his kind Uncle Sam feeds ten trillion in change into the total entertainment combat video game. (...) See the children bleed. It'll look great on the TV.
</blockquote>
