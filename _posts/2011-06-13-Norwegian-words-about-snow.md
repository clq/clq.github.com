title: Norwegian Words about Snow (A list in progress)  
---  
  
One day I thought, "Hey! I should list all Norwegian words about snow!" Then I did. It has been a work in progress that I have kept coming back to for almost exactly a year now.  
  
So, below is a list of Norwegian words about snow. It is probably far from comprehensive, and some of the translations are probably a bit off, but it is -a- list of Norwegian snow-words.

Note that a lot of the words are not commonly used, and a large amount are regional. However, though I haven't checked every single one, I think they are all officially accepted as Norwegian words.

I got the huge majority of these words from the great list at http://www.nhdesign.com/snjoord.html, which seems to have set out to make a list like this. However, there are very few translations, and the definitions are incomplete. I did my best at translating and defining the remaining words, and also collected some words from various other sources.  
  
I have omitted a large chunk of words: I am not including words that are, or describe equipment used to interact with snow. I have also omitted words where I think they become a little ridiculous (like snow-dog, snow-bear, snow-bunny, etc.)  
  
The list is far from perfect, but if I tried making it perfect I would probably never get it published at all, so consider this a beta-version. If you find any errors or omissions, please comment. With some time this could perhaps become a really good list of Norwegian snow-words
