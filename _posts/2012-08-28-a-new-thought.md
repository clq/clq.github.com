Sometimes I feel like writing something that is longer than a Tweet. I do have a blog, but for some reason I always end up overthinking anything that goes on my actual blog. This leaves me without anywhere to post more random, less formal, and less thought out stuff I just feel like writing. I thought about taking Tumblr back up, but I have this website, so I figured I might as well use it. This is the first post in a new section I think of as "thoughts", a place to dump any random thought that comes into my head. Or a funny video. Or an image. Or something.
